If you want Ignite to generate pages based on Markdown files, you should place them in here. You can group your content however, you want – category, year, etc – just by placing them into subfolders of Content.

The same path (minus "Content") is used to place your rendered Markdown files in the Build folder, but you can also use the "path" YAML front matter to customize this.
